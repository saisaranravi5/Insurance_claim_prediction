# Insurance Claim Prediction  

This project predicts the likelihood of an insurance customer filing a claim during the policy period using machine learning techniques. It combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models to support **risk management, pricing strategies, and fraud detection** in the insurance industry.

## 🔎 Problem Statement  
Insurance companies face challenges in **identifying high-risk customers** and **optimizing premium pricing**. Accurate claim prediction can help insurers:  
- Reduce financial risk  
- Detect fraudulent claims  
- Promote safe driving with incentives  
- Improve overall profitability

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Size**: 10,000 records  
- **Features**: 18 (demographics, driving history, vehicle details)  
- **Target Variable**: Whether a customer filed a claim  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Imputed missing values  
   - Dropped irrelevant variables  
   - Encoded categorical features  
   - Scaled numerical features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identified key drivers: credit score, past accidents, traffic violations  
   - Visualized trends with Matplotlib & Seaborn  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
   - Ensemble (Bagging + Cross-Validation)  

---

## 📈 Results  
- Logistic Regression → **71% accuracy**  
- Random Forest → **83% accuracy**  
- Bagging Ensemble → **85% accuracy with 71% recall**  

---

## 💡 Business Impact  
- Enables **risk-based pricing** by identifying high-risk customers  
- Supports **fraud detection** with better claim classification  
- Helps insurers design **customer engagement programs** (safe driving incentives, tailored policies)
